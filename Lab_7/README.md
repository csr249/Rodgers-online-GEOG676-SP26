# Lab 7

Topic: Raster analysis

Task:
- Find and download satellite imagery that is split up by band. Landsat is a great choice. Add the imagery to your Github.
- Using the satellite imagery you downloaded, create a composite raster image
- Find a digital elevation model of your area of interest and create the following: Shace-Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is a great choice. Add the DEM to your Github.
- A hillshade analysis raster
- A slope analysis raster

## Deliverables

- Link to your Github page that contains the Python code 60pts
- Provide screenshot of your composit raster image 20pts
- Provide screenshot of your hillshade raster image 10pts
- Provide screenshot of you slope analysis raster image 10pts
