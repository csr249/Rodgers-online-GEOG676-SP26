# Lab 4

Topic: Fun with arcpy

Outcomes:
- Learn how to build an iterator.
- Learn several of the general purpose container data types.
- Learn how to use Arcpy to 1) setup a workspace; 2) create a geodatabase; and 3) find example arcpy code.
- Learn how to manipulate feature layers and perform some basic spatial analysis (e.g. buffering, intersection) using arcpy.

Task:
- Read in garage location X/Y coords from the provided .csv
- Create a geodatabase and add in the input layers
- Buffer the garage points
- Intersect the buildings layer with the buffered garage points
- Output the resulting table to a .csv

## Deliverables

- Link to GitHub page that contains the Python code, GDB, and CSV resulting table
- Screenshot of the executed code
